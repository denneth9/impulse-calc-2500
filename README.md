# impulse-calc-2500
 A program to calculate rocket impulse from load cell testing data, with graphing and other additional functions
 New version of impulse-calc-2000 (https://github.com/denneth9/impulse-calc-2000) that includes exporting to RASP
 (note to self: embrace version control to stop programs from multiplying every major iteration)

Functions:
- Impulse calculation from kilogram values and a time interval
- Specific impulse in newton seconds and seconds from impulse and propellant weight
- Graph of thrust profile that can be exported to a png
- Peak thrust
- Total thrust time
- Average impulse
- Advanced Error Correction and specific optimizations for my own test data
- Export thrustcurve to RASP (https://www.thrustcurve.org/info/raspformat.html)
- A graphic user interface made in windows forms

Based of the calculations found on nakka's amazing site, painstakingly converted to non american units
